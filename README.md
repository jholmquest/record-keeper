Madison College Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a simple
website with basic CRUD functionality. The site will be used to track various
abilities known by a character in a fantasy tabletop setting. It will hold the
names of verious abilities and links to information about them from the official
documentation. Pathfinder 2nd Edition was selected as the game as it has such
documentation readily available and accessable for free.
